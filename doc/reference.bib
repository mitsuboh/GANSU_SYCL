The calculation of the excitation energies is in agreement with the qualitative features of the observed spectra, i.e., absorption in the far ultraviolet for ClO4−, two strong maxima in the visible or near ultraviolet for MnO4− and CrO4= with the chromate spectrum displaced toward higher energies. An approximate calculation of the relative f‐values for the first transitions in CrO4= and MnO4− is also in agreement with experiment.The data on the absorption spectra of permanganate ion in different crystalline fields is interpreted in terms of the symmetries of the excited states predicted by our calculations.},

Thus, the present formulation can cover a large class of molecular integrals necessary for theoretical studies of molecular systems by ab initio calculations, and furthermore provides us with an efficient scheme of computing them by virtue of its recursive nature.}",

Similar formulas involving the same auxiliary functions are given for the common charge moments, electric-field operators, and spin-interaction operators. Recursion relations are given for the auxiliary functions which make possible the use of Gaussian functions of arbitrarily large angular momentum. An algorithm is described for the computation of electron repulsion integrals.}

Application to the SCF problem is treated in detail.}
